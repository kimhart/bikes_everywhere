In order to receive a helmet you must: be present, learn how to properly fit and wear a helmet, and sign a waiver <strong>(a parent or legal guardian must sign for children under 18).</strong><p>

        <h3>Don’t Be a Jerk</h3>
          <p>DOT’s <em>Don’t Be A Jerk</em> bike safety campaign humorously highlights the essential dos and don’ts of safe, responsible biking. According to DOT’s 2010 Sustainable Streets Index, commuter cycling increased 262% in New York City from 2000 to 2010. With more bikes on the road, smart cycling is even more crucial to making New York City’s streets safer for everyone using them.</p>

        <h3>Safety Tips</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Ride in a straight line, obey traffic signs and signals, and do not weave in and out of traffic. Riding predictably reduces your chances of a crash with a motor vehicle.</li>
          <li>Look, signal and look again before changing lanes or making a turn. Establish eye contact with drivers. Seeing a driver is often not enough. Make sure drivers see you before executing a turn or riding in front of a turning car.</li>
          <li>Watch out for car doors. Be prepared for the possibility that a car door may be opened in your path. When possible, leave room between yourself and parked cars (3 feet is generally recommended) so that you can avoid a door that opens unexpectedly.</li>
          <li>Stay visible. Wear brightly cliored clothing for daytime riding. At night, use reflective materials and lights.</li>
          <li>Use your bell. Your bell alerts drivers, pedestrians and other cyclists to your presence, it is required by law.</li>
          <li>Don't wear earphones. By law you may wear one earbud, but keeping your ears clear is a much safer choice.</li>
          <li>Wear a helmet. Helmets are required by law for children age 13 or younger and working cyclists, helmets are a good idea for cyclists of all ages.</li>
